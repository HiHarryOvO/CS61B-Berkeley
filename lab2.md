Intellij IDEA provides powerful debugging tools.

"step into" runs literally every step of the code while 
"step over" calls a function without showing the execution 
of the function. 

"step out" could escape the current function.

Right click the breakpoint in Intellij IDEA could set conditional 
breakpoints by which the debugging process stops at where the condition 
is violated. (quite useful)
