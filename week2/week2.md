GRoE (golden rule of equals) -- equals: copy all the bits.

Everything else than primitive types is a reference type.

Basically in java, you always pass by value.

## 2.1 Exercises

The extra exercises are implementing the incrList() function and the dincrList() function. 
At first I was doing both in an iterative way and it turned out that for me, writing incrList() 
iteratively is kind of tortuous for me in the beginning. 

After I solved them, it occurred to me that using recusion method might be 
more natual. Therefore, I figured out incrRecursionList() but still have no idea about the dincrRecursionList(). 
Looks unsolvable to me because IntList L passed to the function are changing everytime we run it.
